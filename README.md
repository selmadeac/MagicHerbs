# MagicHerbs
Magic Herbs is a new game project designed in Unity and Visual Studio. This game was created for educational purposes. 

All 3d models are taken from the Unity Asset Store. All used models were free. 
I thank the authors of the 3D models for sharing their incredible work. This game would not have been possible without them.
